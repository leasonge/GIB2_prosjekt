                This Web page was set up as a demo on the Ubuntu server. It was built with a django backend and a react frontend, but note that you are free to choose whatever technology you prefer.
                This web page has simple functionality (see the "student to sign up"  functionality below) to read/write to the postgres database instance running on the server.
                <br />
                <br />
                Please note that this application is only for demo-purposes. The repo is available at <a href="https://github.com/Lauvsnes1/react-django-example/tree/main" > this github repo</a>. You can use it as inspiration and a guide on how you connect
                to the server and r/w to the database, but I strongly encourage you to build the application yourselves, as the learning outcome is much higher. Remember that a thourogh guide on connecting to the geomatics server is available on blackboard too.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you need help you can come to me in the student assistent hours at room L11 on fridays from 12:15 - 14:00 (as long as nothing else is written on blackboard) or email me on evenlau@stud.ntnu.no.
